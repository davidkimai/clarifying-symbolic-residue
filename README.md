# clarifying-symbolic-residue
Symbolic Residue is the structural mathematical pattern left behind by constrained expressionâ€”whether biological, cultural, or algorithmic. This repository distills a series of advanced theorems into a cohesive framework for frontier AI research labs, providing interpretive clarity and structural traceability in model behavior under constraint.
